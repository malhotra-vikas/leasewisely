- Rent Withholding: The tenant can refuse to pay rent and use the existence of the problem as a defense in any legal action, such as an eviction lawsuit, that the landlord might initiate.
Tenants considering withholding rent must proceed with caution. Improper rent withholding can lead to the court siding with the landlord, giving grounds for eviction due to nonpayment of rent. For instance, a tenant with a history of missing rent payments may not be eligible for this remedy.

This remedy allows tenants to deduct up to a total of 4 months' rent within any 12-month period. Alternatively, if the landlord does not make the necessary repairs, the tenant can consider the lease canceled and move out.
